# Sample saving WPF Application configurations

>This is a sample project that proposes a way to use grouped configurations in a single application.

Initialize or link configurations using the <code>Managers.SystemVariableManager</code> singleton class.   
The set values are saved through the json file.   
The json file for setting the initial value is built with the included resource as 'appsettings.json'.
